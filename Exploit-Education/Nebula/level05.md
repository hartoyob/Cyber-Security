# level05

## Challenge Info
Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions

## Solution

Only one hint provided, weak folder permissions. The only with alot more permissions that the others (the one that stand out) is the .backup folder.


.tgz is a compressed file so need to extract it 

```
tar zxfv backup (...) -C /tmp/l05/

cd /tmp/l05
```

Since this need to access flag05 account to issue getflag and retrieve the flag, the private key present (<b>id_rsa</b>) may belong to that account.

Instead of just copying the key to the .ssh on level05 account, we can specify it in the arguments

```
ssh flag05@127.0.0.1 -i /tmp/l05/id_rsa
getflag
```

### Flag
```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account 
```
