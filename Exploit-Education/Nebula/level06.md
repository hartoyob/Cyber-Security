# level06

## Challange information
The flag06 account credentials came from a legacy unix system.

## Solution

In older unix systems the password hashes were stored in the passwd file.

```
cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
```

resulting in the following entry 

```
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

When running a hash cracker (used an online tool, but john would give the same result) the result was


```
ueqwOCnSGdsuM:hello
```

Now issue
```
su flag06
password: hello
getflag
```

## Flag

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
