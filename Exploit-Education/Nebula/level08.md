# Level08

## Challenge info
World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account.

## Solution

When listing all the files at the /home/flag08 there is only one file named <b> capture.pcap</b>

Copied that over to my machine

```
scp level08@192.168.1.142:/home/flag08/capture.pcap capture.pcap
```

Opening it with wireshark and following the TCP stream, we can see that someone tried to login at a webserver with the user wwwbugs.

Some parts of the ASCII convertion were not printable (in that format) so i changed the print format to UTF-8.

The password Captured in the .pcap file was
```
backdoor00Rm8ate
```

Now, since the capture file wont provide anything more, i tried to switch user to flag08 and use that password, and it worked.

```
su flag08
Password: backdoor00Rm8ate
getflag
```
