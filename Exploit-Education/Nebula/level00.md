# level 00 

## Challenge info


This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

Alternatively, look at the find man page.


## Solution

-> find the file with suid bit set

```
cd /
find . -perm /4000 | grep flag

cd /bin/...
./flag00
getflag
```

## flag 
```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
